[Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v2.0.0) is
released!  It is a major version bump because it contains breaking changes that
may require user code changes.

<!--more-->

## Breaking changes

As part of periph's [compatibility
guarantee](/project/library/#compatibility-guarantee), breaking changes can only
occur on major version bump.

- [conn/gpio/gpioreg](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg): Removed
  `ByNumber()`.
- [conn/spi](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/spi): Renamed `Port.DevParams()` to
  [Connect()](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/spi#Port) to better convey that a
  connected _Port_ becomes a _Conn_.
- [devices](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices):
  [Device](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices#Device) doesn't embed
  [fmt.Stringer](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Stringer) anymore.
  [Display](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices#Display) and
  [Environmental](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices#Environmental) now embed
  [Device](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices#Device).
- devices/bme280: renamed to
  [devices/bmxx80](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/bmxx80), now supporting
  all three of BMP180/BME280/BMP280.
- [host/pmem](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/pmem): Renamed `Mem.Struct()` to
  [AsPOD()](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/pmem#Mem) and made it support array
  and slices.

## New features

This release brings a whole set of new features:

- [conn](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn): Added documentation about the
  [concepts](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn#hdr-Concepts):
  [Bus](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn#hdr-Bus),
  [Port](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn#hdr-Port) and
  [Conn](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn#hdr-Conn).
- [conn/pin/pinreg](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/pin/pinreg): when mapping a
  physical board header via
  [pinreg.Register()](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/pin/pinreg#Register), any
  [pin.Pin](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/pin#Pin) that also implements
  [gpio.PinIO](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio#PinIO) are
  now automatically aliased as `<board>_<pin number>` in the GPIO registry
  [conn/gpio/gpioreg](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg).
- [devices](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices): Added
  [Environmental.SenseContinuous()](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices#Environmental).
- [cmd/ssd1306](https://periph.io/x/periph/cmd/ssd1306) and
  [devices/ssd1306](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/ssd1306): Removed
  dependency on [golang.org/x/image/...](https://golang.org/x/image/) in both
  the command and in the device driver's tests, making periph a library that
  depends only on pure stdlib, even for the executables in cmd/.
- [host/allwinner](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/allwinner): Removed
  accidental dependency on [github.com/kr/pretty](https://github.com/kr/pretty).
  Oops!
- Added [travis
  check](https://github.com/google/periph/blob/v2.0.0/.travis.yml#L12) to never
  allow a non-stdlib dependency ever again.
- Various minor improvements: documentation, typos, better golint and go vet
  compliance, code coverage increase.
