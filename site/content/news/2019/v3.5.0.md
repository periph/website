[Version 3.5.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v3.5.0) is
released!

This is the first release that is [go
modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) friendly. The
[go.mod](https://github.com/google/periph/blob/master/go.mod) is the simplest
you can think of, since periph doesn't depends on any other third party library
at the moment.

Go 1.6 and earlier is not supported anymore. This is required to be able to
start using the package [context](https://golang.org/pkg/context).

The new release contains [28
changes](https://github.com/google/periph/compare/v3.4.0...v3.5.0)
from 6 contributors for a diff stat of ` 62 files changed, 4843 insertions(+),
2150 deletions(-)`.

## New packages

- [ccs811](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/ccs811): driver for
  CCS811 Volatile Organic Compounds sensor.
- [inky](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/inky): driver for Inky
  pHAT e-ink screens.


## Improvements

- [as7262](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/as7262): Improve
  internal handling and fix flaky test.
- [i2c](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/i2c): Add Stringer for i2c.Addr
- [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): Fix inconsistencies in
  Set() methods, improve rounding.
- [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): Add unitless frequency,
  added Temperature.Celsius() and Fahrenheit(); make all commands to use
  Frequency for flag.
- [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): Add examples to convert each
  type to float64.
- [fs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/fs): added IOx() linux IOCTL functions to
  generate the code points. The old Ioctl() implementation translating the ioctl
  code on MIPS were not working correctly because I²C ioctl are hardcoded (!) on
  linux. This fixes once for all support on MIPS.
- [fs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/fs): Fixed EpollCreate() call on arm64.
- [sysfs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs): implement SenseContinuous in
  ThermalSensor.
- Travis:
  - Bumped to go1.11.5.
  - Fix conditions to actually run tests. Oops.
  - New check to block go binaries from being merged in.
- Added go.mod to enable builds outside GOPATH.
- Dropped support for Go before 1.7.
