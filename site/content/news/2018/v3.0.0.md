[Version 3.0.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v3.0.0) is
released!

This is a breaking changes major version bump, refactoring many APIs based on
the learnings made in the past year, acquired hindsight by fine tuning drivers
and feedback from users.

We do not take this lightly!

Every single breaking change was done thoughtfully. We consider users have the
right for an explanation why their time is spent on this, so this document lists
the rationale for every single breaking change.

## Breaking changes

You will likely be affected by the following changes. They are described along
the rationale, expected symptom and what you have to do to update your client
code:

- [conn/gpio](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio): Merged PinDefaultPull into
  PinIn, PinPWM into PinOut.
  - Rationale: The PinDefaultPull and PinPWM were added in v2 to not expand
    PinIn and PinOut, which we considered a breaking change. Now for v3, merging
    the interfaces simplifies utilisation.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Simplify references by removing the cast to PinDefaultPull or
    PinPWM, they are now unnecessary.
- [conn/i2c](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/i2c) and
  [conn/spi](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/spi): Change all the `hz`
  parameters to use physic.Frequency. This affects the functions Connect(),
  LimitSpeed() and SetSpeed().
  - Rationale: This enables a 0.000001 Hertz resolution consistently across the
    package, and enables methods like Duration() to convert to time.Duration.
    This enables using constants like MegaHertz, which makes easier to read
    expressions like `10 * physic.MegaHertz` versus `10000000`. A
    ParseFrequency() ala
    [ParseDuration()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) is planned but
    I [ran out of time](https://github.com/google/periph/issues/242).
  - Symptom: Runtime error, either the driver refuses the specified frequency or
    everything runs at a one millionth the desired speed (or 0).
  - Required work: Multiply the value with Hertz, KiloHertz or MegaHertz.
- [conn/physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): Increase
  RelativeHumidity precision by 10x.
  - Rationale: the BME280 has an higher precision that what RelativeHumidity was
    providing.
  - Symptom: humidity value is 10x larger than expected.
  - Required work:  Use the RH constants in package physic.
- [devices](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices): Was stripped of most of its
  types into [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic).
  - Rationale: This required drivers in host (like sysfs) to import package
    devices, which was a layering violation.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Replace imports of package devices with physic.
- [devices](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices): most types were renamed while
  moved into [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic), and many had
  their base type changed.
  - Rationale: Separate the _what_ (e.g. Temperature) from the _unit_ (e.g.
    MilliKelvin, MilliFahrenheit). This is largely inspired by
    [time.Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration), which has constants
    for MicroSecond, Second, Minute, etc. We decided to stick with fixed point
    instead of floating point as this enables deterministic calculation across
    platforms. We are open to revisiting this decision in v4 based on the
    feedback.
  - Symptom: Compile error, invalid runtime behavior due to incorrect constants.
  - Required work: Update references like devices.Celsius, KPascal,
    Environment to their physic counter parts: Temperature, Pressure, Env. Use
    the constants (Kelvin, Pascal, MicroRH) in physic to convert the units,
    similar to how one would do with time.MicroSecond.
- [devices](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices): Moved the interface
  devices.Display as Drawer in a new
  [conn/display](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/display) package.
  - Rationale: the package devices is only a container for device drivers, not a
    location to define interfaces.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Update references of devices.Display to display.Drawer,
- `devices/devicetest`: Moved to
  [conn/display/displaytest](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/display/displaytest)
  - Rationale: coherency with the mode of devices.Display.
- [conn/display](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/display): changed Drawer.Draw()
  to return an error.
  - Rationale: Draw() didn't return an error to lookalike the draw.Drawer
    interface but that was irrelevant .
  - Symptom: Compile error for device drivers. User code not checking for error.
  - Required work: Update device drivers, check error value.


## Driver specific changes

This changes will affect you if you use this device driver:

- [devices/apa102](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102),
  [devices/bmxx80](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/bmxx80),
  [devices/ds248x](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/ds248x),
  [devices/ssd136](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/ssd1306): Use Opts pattern
  instead of individual arguments in the New() function.
  - Rationale:  This is extensible. This permits to consider adding more members
    to Opts a **non breaking change**, which opens the door to add more
    functionality to a device driver without having to wait for v4. Use a
    DefaultOpts struct instance instead of a function to use more data instead
    of code.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Update the New() call to pass an Opts instance, likely using
    DefaultOpts. Initialize the Opts member via their name, never by order. Use
    `bmxx80.Opts{Temperature: bmxx80.O4x, Pressure: bmxx80.O1x, Humidity:
    bmxx80.O1x, Filter: bmxx80.NoFilter}`, not the short form
    `bmxx80.Opts{bmxx80.O4x, bmxx80.O1x, bmxx80.O1x, bmxx80.NoFilter}`.
- [devices/ds18b20](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/ds18b20): Replaced
  Temperature() method with physic.SenseEnv implementation.
  - Rationale: This makes this sensor behaves like any other temperature sensor,
    so that `physic.SenseEnv` can be passed around.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Update the dev.Temperature() call to use dev.SenseEnv().
- [devices/ds248x](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/ds248x): Remove I²C
  address from the options, to NewI2C() as an explicit argument.
  - Rationale: Coherency with all the other device drivers, which pass the I²C
    address to NewI2C(). The rationale is that many devices support both SPI and
    I²C, so putting the I²C device address in Opts results in an ambiguous
    option.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: update call to New().
- [devices/lepton](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/lepton): Remove cs
  argument from New().
  - Rationale: This was a hack trying to work around issues in the Raspberry Pi
    driver, but this was incorrect. The driver now use the SPI's connection CS
    pin normally.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Update call to New().
- [devices/lepton](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/lepton): Frame uses
  image14bit.Gray14 instead of image.Gray16.
  - Rationale: A perf test determined that using []byte to store uint16 values
    is significantly slower than using []uint16. It is also clunky to use. This
    permits using Intensity14 as the ColorModel, which uses 8191 as full
    intensity.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Update client code to use
    [image14bit](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/lepton/image14bit).
- [devices/lepton](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/lepton): Replaced
  ReadImg() with NextFrame().
  - Rationale: ReadImg() required doing a memory allocation at every call,
    NextFrame() permits reusing Frame instances, reducing heap churn.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Update client code to preallocate the frame with `f :=
    Frame{Gray14: image14bit.NewGray14(dev.Bounds())}`.


## Lesser changes

These changes have no required work unless you wrote a device driver:

- [cmd/apa102](https://periph.io/x/periph/cmd/apa102): Default intensity
  increased from 127 to 255.
- [conn](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn): Add String() to Resource.
  - Rationale: This permits to have a clear naming convention to help explain
    the user what is being used. This enables removing a lot of dependency on
    fmt.
- [conn/gpio](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio): Changed DutyMax from
  1<<16-1 to 1<<24.
  - Rationale: The fact that it was 1<<16-1 was to keep it under 16 bits but
    caused usability issues, as half wasn't an exact number.
  - Symptom: Invalid runtime behavior due to incorrect constants.
  - Required work: Use values in referece to DutyMax.
- [conn/gpio](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio): PWM() now accepts a
  physic.Frequency instead of time.Duration period.
  - Rationale: While clock period is logical, it is really hard to relate. Users
    will have a much easier time to understand 10kHz than 100µs.
  - Symptom: Compile error.
  - Required work: Use frequency instead of clock period.
- [conn/gpio](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio): Pull constants changed,
  PullNoChange is now 0, instead of Float.
  - Rationale: It is default value, which is more useful (and expected) than
    Float.
  - Symptom: Invalid runtime behavior due to incorrect constants.
  - Required work: Explicitly specify Float where it was assumed to be the
    default.
- [conn/gpio/gpioreg](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg): Remove
  prefered argument to Register().
  - Rationale: The reason that led to this argument were not needed anymore.
    This was due to parallelism between sysfs-gpio and CPU GPIO drivers.
- [conn/gpio/gpiostream](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream):
  Rewrote.
  - Rationale: Its implementation proved to be suboptimal. Since this package
    wasn't used much yet, now was the right time to refactor it.
- [conn/gpio/gpiotest](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiotest): PinPWM
  was merged into Pin.
  - Rationale: This follows that gpio.PinPWM was merged into gpio.PinOut.
- [conn/pin](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/pin): pin.Pin is now a
  conn.Resource, so it implements Halt().
  - Rationale: Make everything a Resource, so they can be enumerated (via
    String()) and halted on shutdown if desired.
- [conn/physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): Added
  SenseEnv.Precision(), implemented in all drivers.
  - Rationale: It is useful for the application to know at which precision the
    sensor is making its measurement.
- [host/sysfs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs): Renamed SetSpeedHook to
  I2CSetSpeedHook.
  - Rationale: This function is I²C specific, but it was not clear from the
    name.
- [periph](https://periph.io/x/periph): Added After() to interface Driver.
  - Rationale: Was needed to untangle the sysfs-gpio and CPU drivers, and host
    pin headers. This enabled automatic fallback to sysfs GPIO driver when sysfs
    loaded but the CPU GPIO driver failed to load, which may require running as
    root.


## Additional improvements

These are not breaking changes:

- [cci](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/lepton/cci): implements SenseEnv to
  be used as a temperature sensor. This returns the housing temperature.
  - Rationale: This permits to use all the temperature sensors connected to a
    host in the same way.
- [experimental](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental): Many drivers were
  improved towards being moved into non-experimental. These are not considered
  breaking changes.
- The code is now tested on go1.5.4. This makes it easier for users to just `apt
  install golang` and immediately get going.
- [conn](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn): Removed all dependencies on /devices
  or /host, by moving the smoketests under /cmd/periph-smoketest. Added travis
  checks to verify.


## Going forward

Some of the changes here are to enable new drivers like the FT232H and FT232R,
which enables a less Linux-focused driver support.
