[Version 3.4.0](https://github.com/google/periph/releases/tag/v3.4.0) is
released!

This is a feature and bug fix release, the last one for 2018.

Special thanks to [NeuralSpaz](https://github.com/NeuralSpaz) for his
outstanding contributions to the physic package.

This is the **last** version supporting go1.6 and lower. periph v3.5.0 will
require go1.7 or later.

## New packages

- [sn3218](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/sn3218):
  experimental support for sn3218 LED driver.
- [mcp9808](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/mcp9808):
  experimental support for digital temperature sensor.


## Improvements

### Stable packages

- [gpiostream](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpiostream): make
  PinIn/PinOut implement pin.Pin. This is technically a breaking change but we
  do not expect any consumer to have implemented this interface.
- [i2c](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/i2c): Adds i2c.Addr type, it implements
  flag.Value. This will make it possible to directly accept an I²C address in
  command line tools.
- [gpio](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio#example-PinOut--PWM): fix PWM
  example to show up in godoc.
- [physic](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/physic): make all types implement
  flag.Value; add Frequency RPM; add 4 new Energy constants; improve
  Angle.String(); performance improvements.
- [sysfs](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs): incude thermal sensors from
  hwmon.
- [gpiosmoketest](https://periph.io/x/periph/cmd/periph-smoketest/gpiosmoketest):
  test that Halt unblocks WaitForEdge; make sysfs.Pin detection work with
  aliases


### Experimental packages

- [analog](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/conn/analog): improve PinADC
  and PinDAC, rename Reading to Sample.
- [hx711](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/hx711): implement
  analog.PinADC.
- [bitbang](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/bitbang): make i2c
  use physic.Frequency.
- [ina219](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/ina219): Fix
  currentLSB calculation.
- [pca9548](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/pca9548): i2c
  multiplexer.
- [nrzled](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/nrzled): clean up NRZ
  encoded as 3 or 4 bits; merge SPIDev into Dev.
- [ads1x15](https://periph.io/x/periph/experimental/devices/ads1x15): fixed
  synchronization, added cmd tool.


### Other

- gohci: run periph-smoketest gpio smoketest on both RPi and BeagleBone.
- Reduce the number of golint reports.
- Stop using t.Fail() and FailNow.
- Add github templates for bug report and pull request.
