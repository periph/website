# Overview

[periph.io/x/periph](https://periph.io/x/periph) is a standalone library with no
external dependency to interface with low-level board facilities exposed by the
OS or leveraged against OS' will. It can be viewed as a lower level layer than
[Gobot](https://gobot.io), and yes we're discussing to collaborate in the
future!


# Features

- No external dependencies
- No C dependency, doesn't use `cgo`
- Explicit initialization: know what [hardware is detected and what is
  not](https://github.com/google/periph/tree/master/cmd/periph-info)
- Interfaces:
  - [GPIO](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio): both memory mapped
  registers and edge detection
  - [I²C](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/i2c)
  - [SPI](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/spi)
  - [1-wire](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/onewire)
- [Devices](/device/): [apa102](/device/#apa102), [bme280](/device/#bme280),
  [ds18b20](/device/#ds18b20), [ds248x](/device/#ds248x),
  [lepton](/device/#lepton), [ssd1306](/device/#ssd1306),
  [tm1637](/device/#tm1637).
- Continuously tested via [gohci](https://github.com/periph/gohci) on:
  - [BeagleBone](/platform/#beaglebone)
  - [C.H.I.P.](/platform/#chip)
  - [ODROID-C1+](/platform/#odroid-c1)
  - [Raspberry Pi](/platform/#raspberrypi)
  - [Windows 10 VM](/platform/#windows)


## WARNING

**This library is unstable. Breaking API changes occur frequently.**

If you want to use `periph.io/x/periph`, please [vendor
periph](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PackageManagementTools) first and
frequently roll.


# Documentation

  CHIP, etc) and OSes plus tips and tricks.
- [device/](/device/) for an overview of included device drivers and examples.
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph?status.svg)](https://periph.io/x/periph)
- [project/](/project/) to read about design goals, using as a libray, using
  included tools, contribution rules or expand the list of supported hardware.


# Tools

`periph` includes [many ready-to-use
tools](https://github.com/google/periph/tree/master/cmd/)! See [project/tools/](/project/tools/)
for more info about using the included tools.

```bash
# Retrieve and install all the commands at once:
go get periph.io/x/periph/cmd/...
# List the host drivers registered and/or initialized:
periph-info
# List the known headers:
headers-list
# List the known GPIO state:
gpio-list
```


# Library

For [application developers](/project/library/), using `periph` as a library
provides OS-independent bus interfacing. It really tries hard to _get out of the
way_.  Here's the canonical "toggle a LED" example:


~~~go
package main

import (
    "time"
    "periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio"
    "periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg"
    "periph.io/x/periph/host"
)

func main() {
    host.Init()
    for l := gpio.Low; ; l = !l {
        gpioreg.ByNumber(13).Out(l)
        time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
~~~

The following are synonyms, use the form you prefer:

- Runtime discovery:
  - [`gpioreg.ByNumber(13)`](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg#ByNumber) or
    [`gpioreg.ByName("13")`](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg#ByName)
  - [`gpioreg.ByName("GPIO13")`](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg#ByName)
- Using global variables:
  - [`rpi.P1_33`](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/rpi#P1_33) to
    select the pin via its _position on the board_
  - [`bcm283x.GPIO13`](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x#GPIO13) for the
    pin as defined by the CPU

This example uses basically no CPU: the
[Out()](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio#PinOut) call doesn't call
into the kernel. Instead it directly changes the GPIO memory mapped register.

# Contributions

`periph` provides an extensible driver registry and common bus interfaces which
are explained in more details at [project/](/project/). `periph` is designed to
work well with drivers living in external repositories so you are not _required_
to fork the periph repository to load out-of-tree drivers for your platform.

**Every commit is [tested on real hardware](/project/contributing/#testing)
via [gohci](https://github.com/periph/gohci) workers.**

We gladly accept contributions for documentation improvements and from device
driver developers via GitHub pull requests, as long as the author has signed the
Google Contributor License. Please see
[project/contributing/](/project/contributing/) for more details.


# Philosophy

1. Optimize for simplicity, correctness and usability in that order.
   - e.g. everything, interfaces and structs, uses strict typing, there's no
     `interface{}` in sight.
2. OS agnostic. Clear separation of interfaces in
   [conn/](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn),
   enablers in [host/](https://periph.io/x/periph/host) and device
   drivers in [devices/](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices).
   - e.g. no devfs or sysfs path in sight.
   - e.g. conditional compilation enables only the relevant drivers to be loaded
     on each platform.
3. ... yet doesn't get in the way of platform specific code.
   - e.g. A user can use statically typed global variables
     [rpi.P1_3](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/rpi#P1_3),
     [bcm283x.GPIO2](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x#GPIO2)
     to refer to the exact same pin on a Raspberry Pi.
3. The user can chose to optimize for performance instead of usability.
   - e.g.
     [apa102.Dev](https://periph.io/x/periph/devices/apa102#Dev)
     exposes both high level
     [draw.Image](https://golang.org/pkg/image/draw/#Image) to draw an image and
     low level [io.Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer) to write raw RGB
     24 bits pixels. The user chooses.
4. Use a divide and conquer approach. Each component has exactly one
   responsibility.
   - e.g. instead of having a driver per "platform", there's a driver per
     "component": one for the CPU, one for the board headers, one for each
     bus and sensor, etc.
5. Extensible via a [driver
   registry](https://periph.io/x/periph#Register).
   - e.g. a user can inject a custom driver to expose more pins, headers, etc.
     A USB device (like an FT232H) can expose headers _in addition_ to the
     headers found on the board.
6. The drivers must use the fastest possible implementation.
   - e.g. both [allwinner](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/allwinner) and
     [bcm283x](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/bcm283x) leverage [sysfs
     gpio](https://periph.io/x/periph/host/sysfs#Pin) to expose interrupt driven
     edge detection, yet use memory mapped GPIO registers to perform
     single-cycle reads and writes.
