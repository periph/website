# Overview

[periph.io/x/periph](https://periph.io/x/periph) is a standalone hardware
library with no external dependency. It can be viewed as a lower level layer
than [Gobot](https://gobot.io), and yes we're discussing to collaborate in the
future!


# Features

- No external dependencies.
- No C dependency, doesn't use `cgo`.
- Explicit initialization: know what [hardware is detected and what is
  not](https://github.com/google/periph/tree/master/cmd/periph-info).
- [Interfaces](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn):
  [GPIO](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio) (with edge detection),
  [I²C](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/i2c),
  [SPI](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/spi),
  [1-wire](https://periph.io/x/periph/conn/onewire).
- [Continuously tested](/project/contributing/#testing) via
  [gohci](https://github.com/periph/gohci).
- [SemVer](http://semver.org) compatibility guarantee.

# Tools

`periph` includes many [ready-to-use tools](/project/tools/):

```bash
go get periph.io/x/periph/cmd/...
# List the host drivers registered and/or initialized:
periph-info
# List the board headers:
headers-list
# List the state of each GPIO:
gpio-list
# Set P1_7/GPIO4 on a Raspberry Pi to high:
gpio-write P1_7 1
```


# Library

`periph` tries hard to get out of the way when [used as a
library](/project/library/).

[![GoDoc](/img/godoc.svg)](https://godoc.org/periph.io/x/periph)

Here's the minimal "toggle a LED" example:

~~~go
package main

import (
    "time"
    "periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio"
    "periph.io/x/periph/conn/gpio/gpioreg"
    "periph.io/x/periph/host"
)

func main() {
    host.Init()
    p := gpioreg.ByName("11")
    t := time.NewTicker(500 * time.Millisecond)
    for l := gpio.Low; ; l = !l {
        p.Out(l)
        <-t.C
    }
}
